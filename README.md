# deFolder
## A small script to extract all files from subfolders to another path.
### With this you will be able to remove a file tree and move every file to another folder.

# Setup
Fist of all, you need some path to 'deFolder' so this can take effect. At least one subfolder is needed and every action the script does can be easily changed to your needs.

To set this repo up, you'll need to open the terminal and type:

 1. Navigate to the path where you want the repo: `cd <path>`
 2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/appuchias/deFolder.git`
 3. Navigate inside the repo folder: `cd deFolder`
 4. Open `paths.txt` and type the source folder in the first line and the destination folder in the second one.
 Note that the destination folder mustn't be in any case a subfolder of the root one.
 5. From the terminal, run the `main.py` file: `python main.py`
 6. When it finishes, it will show "Program finished!"
