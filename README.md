## How it works

This will move all files in subfolders to their root folder. Using `os.walk` it will cycle every child folder recursively and if files are found, move them to the parent folder, prepending the folder name to the file name.

The silent and verbose options allow you to choose whether to know what changes have happened or not. Silent will remove all output and verbose will show all changes.
